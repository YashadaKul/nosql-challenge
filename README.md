## Overview
The main tasks for this project were:
* Setup: Import a json file in a python environment, use it as a database and use PyMongo to add new fields, update existing ones. analyse its data. 
* Analysis: Filters, sort methods, regex and aggregation pipelines were used to query the database. Finally, results were converted to pandas dataframes for further analysis. 

## Usage

To run the Jupyter Note files, follow these general steps:

1. Open the folder where you have stored this repo locally
2. Open Jupyterlab from your terminal from that folder
